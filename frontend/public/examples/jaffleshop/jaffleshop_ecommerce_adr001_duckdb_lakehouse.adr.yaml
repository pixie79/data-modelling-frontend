title: Use DuckDB as the Lakehouse Engine
status: accepted
category: technology
context: |
  Jaffleshop needs a data lakehouse solution to support analytics workloads.
  The solution must:
  - Handle both batch and interactive queries efficiently
  - Support standard SQL syntax
  - Integrate with dbt for transformations
  - Be cost-effective for a growing business
  - Support local development without cloud infrastructure

  We evaluated several options including Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery,
  and DuckDB. Each has different trade-offs in terms of cost, complexity,
  and capabilities.

decision: |
  We will use DuckDB as the primary lakehouse engine for the Jaffleshop
  data platform.

  DuckDB is an embedded analytical database that:
  - Runs in-process with zero external dependencies
  - Provides excellent performance for OLAP workloads
  - Supports full SQL with window functions, CTEs, etc.
  - Has native dbt integration via dbt-duckdb adapter
  - Enables local development without cloud costs
  - Can read/write Parquet files directly

consequences: |
  **Positive:**
  - Zero infrastructure cost for development and testing
  - Fast iteration cycles with in-process execution
  - Easy onboarding for new developers
  - Full SQL compatibility with other databases
  - Excellent performance for datasets up to 100GB
  - Native support for data lake file formats

  **Negative:**
  - May need migration to cloud data warehouse at scale
  - Limited to single-node processing
  - No built-in data sharing features
  - Community support vs enterprise support

  **Mitigations:**
  - Design for portability to Snowflake/BigQuery
  - Monitor data volumes for scaling triggers
  - Document migration path in runbooks
