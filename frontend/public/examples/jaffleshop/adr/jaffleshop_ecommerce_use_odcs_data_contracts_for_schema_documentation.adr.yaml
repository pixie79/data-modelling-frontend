title: Use ODCS Data Contracts for Schema Documentation
status: accepted
category: process
context: |
  As the Jaffleshop data platform scales, we face challenges with:

  - Schema drift between producers and consumers
  - Unclear ownership of data assets
  - Missing or outdated documentation
  - Inconsistent metadata across tables
  - Difficult impact analysis for schema changes

  We need a standardized way to define, document, and enforce data
  contracts between data producers and consumers.
decision: |
  We will use Open Data Contract Standard (ODCS) v3.1.0 for defining
  all data contracts. Each table will have a corresponding `.odcs.yaml`
  file that defines:

  - Schema with column descriptions and data types
  - Data quality rules and validation
  - Ownership and contact information
  - SLA requirements
  - Custom properties for system linking

  All ODCS contracts will be:
  - Stored in version control alongside data assets
  - Validated in CI/CD pipelines
  - Used to generate documentation automatically
  - Linked to their physical implementations
consequences: |
  **Positive:**
  - Single source of truth for schema definitions
  - Automated documentation generation
  - Clear ownership and accountability
  - Version-controlled contract changes
  - Support for data governance tooling

  **Negative:**
  - Additional files to maintain
  - Learning curve for ODCS format
  - Sync overhead between contracts and implementations

  **Mitigations:**
  - Automate contract generation from dbt models
  - Provide templates and examples
  - Add pre-commit hooks for validation
  - Regular audits for contract drift
